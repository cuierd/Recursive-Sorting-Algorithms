# Exercise 5

Hand in until: **May 31st at 23.59**

## Introduction

This exercise is all about algorithms. You will implement recursive algorithms and their dynamic solutions, as well as a sorting algorithm.

Like last week, you will be working in a Jupyter Notebook, where you will find all the exercise descriptions and also solve the exercises. If you need a refresher on how to do this, we've attached a guide below.



## Working with Jupyter Notebook

### Installing Jupyter

Before starting this exercise, make sure you installed Jupyter, since it is not included in Python.

```shell
$ pip install --upgrade pip	# update pip to avoid any issues while installing
$ pip install jupyter
```

### Opening a ```.ipynb``` file

Once Jupyter is installed on your machine, you can clone the GitLab repository as always into your preferred directory. To work on your ```.ipynb``` file, navigate into the directory where the repository is located (using ```$ cd ```) and run ```$ jupyter notebook```.

```shell
$ cd your/path/to/your/repo
$ jupyter notebook
```

Running the last command will automatically open a window in your browser. This happens, because Jupyter is a server-client application. This means, when running Jupyter, it creates a local server which you can access via a URL in a web browser. You can open this Jupyter-interface from anywhere on your computer (even if no notebook is in the dierctory).


### Solving the exercise
For this exercise, you will solve all your tasks directly in a Jupyter Notebook we provide you with. A Jupyter Notebook consist of text cells and code cells, which are executable. To edit a text cell, you can click on the text and use markdown (as used in files like README **.md** ) for formatting. If you're not familiar with markdown, have a look at [this](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/markdown-in-jupyter-notebook) tutorial by DataCamp. To run a cell in the Jupyter Notebook, you can either click on the Run-button, or use the shortcut Command/Control+Enter. Once a number appears to the left of the cell, it has finished running.

## GitLab

To submit your code, upload your notebook as a ```.ipynb``` file to GitLab. Have a look at the instructions on ```OLAT > Material > Tutorial > instructions.pdf``` if you're unsure how to submit your work.

## Deliverables

* Your completed Jupyter notebook

It is **mandatory** to work in pairs. If you have no partner, please contact us so we can set you up with someone. Before submitting, make sure all your code runs and your repository contains all the files you need to hand in.
